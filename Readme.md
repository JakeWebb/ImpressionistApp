This is my Impressionist painting android application for CMSC434. The user can load images and "paint" impressionist style paintings by choosing a special type of brush.
I have four different brush types. The square brush paints a small constant sized square. The line brush paints a slim horizontal rectangle.
The circle brush paints a circle which size is dependent on the speed of the user's finger. The gravity brush uses the device's accelerometer
to move a circle around the canvas to paint color.
